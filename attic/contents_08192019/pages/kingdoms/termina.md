So the legend goes, millennia ago the King Melchior II of [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor) fathered twin sons, Rayan and Elijah. With the line of succession unclear it was decided when the boys came of age they would face one another in a duel for the crown. Ever the dutiful son, Rayan spent every day and night with sword in hand in the practice fields. Elijah, however, was the clever brother and sought gain victory with schemes. The night before the duel he sent his handmaiden to Rayan’s chamber to pilfer his favorite coat.

While Rayan trained with the master at arms to steel his resolve, Elijah stole into his brother’s chamber dressed as his brother. There he found Rayan’s bretrothed, Mhelisa and beseeched her for her favor in the form of a kiss. When Rayan returned home and found his betrothed and brother in a scandalous embrace he grew enraged and clouded of mind. At dawn, the high lords of the kingdom gathered to witness the duel but Rayan could not be found.

It is said that Rayan and his closest attendants fled the kingdom that very night, never to return. They traveled east, past the elfwood and into the farthest reaches of the realm. They faced perils unknown to men before they found the eastern ocean. It was there, at the terminus of the world, that Rayan made his kingdom. Still stinging from his brother’s betrayal he vowed his people would prize honor above all other virtues.

The kingdom of [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) shares many cultural and economic similarities to it’s parent nation, [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor). The nation is ruled over by a king, who is served by anointed lords and defended by oathed knights. However, unlike [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor), Terminan lords and knights earn their titles and wear them as badges of respect, rather than fashion accessories. Soldiers of [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) are gruelingly disciplined and loyal to their crown.

For this reason political and trade relations between [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) and other nations can be quite strained. While most others respect the nation, their slavish devotion to their word and rigid sense of honor has given the kingdom a humorless reputation. It is said that any deal struck with the king of [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) will be upheld to its word, but those words are rarely generous.

Geographically smaller than [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor) and seated in a less fertile region, [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) is nonetheless considered the second most powerful nation in the realm. The zeal and determination of her people has kept the kingdom at the forefront of the geopolitical stage. This is perhaps cemented by the fact that as a country, [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) is more reliant on trade infrastructure than their rival, [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor).

When the first people of [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) settled the eastern reach they discovered the griffin nests high in the mountains of the reaches. It is said Rayan II, heir to the founding king, climbed the fabled Griffin Mount and was the first to tame a flying beast and take to the sky. Ever since, Griffins have been a source of military might and cultural pride for the people of [Termina](/kingdoms/termina).

The iconography of the Terminan culture includes much Griffin themed imagery. Wings, winged depictions of Griffin Mount or the beasts themselves are depicted on flags and badges in every corner of the kingdom. The Griffin mounted Wing Riders are the nation’s elite fighting force and form the backbone of the nation’s defense. Their control of the skies has lent a formidable edge to the small nation that rivals cannot ignore.

While their cousins in [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor) enjoy austentation displays of wealth and status, the people of [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) favor a more conservative approach to life. Fashion is designed with function in mind and edifices are constructed to be practical rather than grandiose. While the kingdom’s capital, Brighton is sprawling metropolis; large cities are fewer and further between. The economic divide between the wealthy and the working class is notably narrower than [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor) with captains of industry choosing to succeed by undaunted effort and force of personality rather than exploitation.

However, life in [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) is no less treacherous for the economically disadvantaged. Opportunities are scarcer and competition can readily push a humble farmer to the breaking point. As the nation is less developed legally, the kingdom’s ability to investigate crimes and reach fair conclusions can give way to summary acts of justice.

Religion in [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) is taken a bit more seriously than other places of the world. The people are not flippant in their devotion to the gods and take their worship as serious as they do any other task. While they have great respect for the sun god’s station within the divine pantheon, Lunaria the moon goddess is more frequently worshipped. The people find a natural kinship with her shrewd wisdom.

The nation has had a tenuous rivalry with [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor) for centuries that has resulted in open conflict countless times. Modern [Termina](/kingdoms/termina) has a strong alliance with their neighbor to the north, [Vallenheim](/kingdoms/vallenheim). The hardened people of the north appreciate Terminan honor while the Terminan people respect the great strength of the north.
