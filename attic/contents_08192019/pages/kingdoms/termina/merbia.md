#### Merbia, Termina

<!-- ##### Events -->
The Group sailed to [Merbia](/kingdoms/termina/merbia) from the Termisian coast via a river boat. When they got to [Merbia](/kingdoms/termina/merbia) they saw that it was under attack by Brotherhood forces. They assisted in defending the city and fending off [The Brotherhood](/groups/the_brotherhood) forces from the surrounding refugee camp. Once inside they went to the [Magis Tower](/places/magis_tower) to speak with [Archmage Brenard](/characters/npcs/archmage_brenard)  on how to destroy [Arcons Breath](/items/arcons_breath). They discovered that [Brenards](/characters/npcs/archmage_brenard) two daughters had disappeared two days earlier and that the [Archmage](/characters/npcs/archmage_brenard) had closed himself off. During their investigation they found that a mysterious man (from the free-lands) named [Zukai](/characters/npcs/zukai) had come into the city and befriended [Brenards](/characters/npcs/archmage_brenard) about a month prior. [Zukai](/characters/npcs/zukai) seemed to be running the [Magis Tower](/places/magis_tower) in [Brenards](/characters/npcs/archmage_brenard) apparent absence. [Genevieve](/characters/pcs/genevieve) and [Aust](/characters/pcs/aust) tracked down a mage named [Jasper](/characters/npcs/jasper) who pointed them in the direction of where the daughters could possibly be.

They tracked down and found both daughters in a temple a few miles outside of the city. [Ral](/characters/pcs/ral_zarek) read the youngest daughters thoughts and discovered that [Zukai](/characters/npcs/zukai) had brought them there. The continued searching the temple and discovered the oldest daughter chained to the wall with magic orbs suspended  above. Her life-force had been leeched and she now resembled a 90 year old woman. While they were unchaining her a winged demonic creature flew down from an opening above and took the orbs.

The Group lead the daughters back to the [Magis Tower](/places/magis_tower) in [Merbia](/kingdoms/termina/merbia) and were showered with praise. They explained to [Brenard](/characters/npcs/archmage_brenard) what had happened. The next day they found [Zukai](/characters/npcs/zukai) in [Brenards](/characters/npcs/archmage_brenard) chambers and [Ral](/characters/pcs/ral_zarek) began hurling spells. [Zukai](/characters/npcs/zukai) revealed himself to be a Succubus and managed to escape.
