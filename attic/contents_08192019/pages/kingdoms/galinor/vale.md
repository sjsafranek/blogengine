#### Vale, Galinor

Captital city of [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor)

The capital, Vale, is a vast, sprawling metropolis. It is considered the cultural and economic hub of the entire realm, though that claim is universally disputed. White collar crime runs rampant through the kingdom and wealthy lords raise mercenary armies to enforce their will. It is a land where the wealthy can fashion their own crowns and claim their own domains until the next wealthiest is able to see them toppled.
