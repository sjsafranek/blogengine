    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>
        Genevieve’s parents, Galinn’dan Il’phel’klir (wood elf, ~400y/o) and Arveene (human, 23y/o), met by happenstance in the forest.  He was immediately taken aback by her pale, Northern Coastal beauty and later won over by her bold personality.  She instantly felt safe with him and fell for his compassion and confidence.  Their love grew quickly and passionately.  She told him little of her background other than she was fleeing the abuse of one of her male family members.  Galinn’dan brought Arveene to his Elven community for refuge; her reception was mixed.  Despite her lack of social etiquette, she was forgivingly charming, had an infectious laugh and a zest for life and learning.  His parents (Varis and Althaea, ~600 y/o) were particularly discouraging of their relationship, hoping he would eventually wed an Elf; this pushed them to elope in secret.  They left the community together, surviving comfortably in the wild until Arveene died in pre-term childbirth.  Galinn’dan returned to the community, grief-stricken, with tiny, baby Genevieve in his arms.

        Genevieve, the only half-Elf raised in this wood-Elven community, was never completely accepted and routinely bullied.  Her relatives took pity on her loneliness and began to teach her various skills with which to occupy her mind and time.  Galinn’dan, a bowyer by trade, taught Genevieve woodworking, how to make bows and arrows, as well as how to skillfully use them.  Varis, her grandfather, strictly taught her combat with various simple and martial weapons and shields.  Althaea showed Genevieve one’s ancient connection with nature, elementals, and healing.  (The other Elves scoff at Althaea’s teachings, considering them to be folktales.)  Genevieve quickly learned and exceled at the several skills, far surpassing the adults’ expectations.  The Elven children often challenged Genevieve to spar; she bested them and, unwittingly, further alienated herself.  Genevieve often escaped to the wilderness, alone, honing her skills and connecting with nature; as she aged, the further and longer she traveled from home.

        On one such outing, around the age of 27, she encountered a caravan that hired her as a tracker/scout through the remainder of their journey – her first adventure.  Over the course of their weeks together, Genevieve was often adored and the center of attention – for the first time in her life.  A man of Turami descent, Marcon, often attempted to flatter and woo her – he called her “Vieve.”  One night when “distracted” by Marcon, the party was viciously attacked by a roaming horde of various chaotic evil humanoid creatures.  Vieve narrowly escaped into the darkness and watched as the members of her party expired one by one.  When the horde finally left, she searched the bodies and unsuccessfully attempted to heal several of them.  She felt intense shame, grief, and anger; Vieve was convinced that the deadliness of the raid was her fault because she had let down her guard and was overly prideful/boastful of her skills.

        Vieve returned home seeking the solace of her family.  However, her father and grandfather, agreed that she was not prepared for a quest and was to blame for the massacre.  Her grandmother attempted to validate Vieve and lovingly convince her there was nothing she could have done.  That night, without a word, Vieve gathered the necessary belongings to survive in the wild and headed out into the darkness.

        Occasionally she happens upon travelers in the wilderness and secretly protects them from danger.  Vieve swore never to be caught unprepared again; she keeps detailed notes about the strengths and weaknesses of the various beasts/races she encounters and prefers tactical strategy to spontaneity.  The concept of chaotic evil still boggles her mind and angers her; she seeks to balance the scales of good/evil and bring order to chaos - at least toward neutral.  Vieve attempts to investigate creatures’ motivations/alignment before acting, preferring to encourage them to compromise or alter their alliances rather than simply kill them.  However, she is comfortable terminating creatures whom she cannot not trust to release and violent creatures with whom she cannot communicate.  Vieve will also engage in self-defense and defend animals, nature, and other creatures that she perceives not to be evil.  She seeks personal redemption for the massacre by continuing to protect others, especially by training them in defensive and/or survival skills. Occasionally (and reluctantly) she is rewarded/paid for her services.  Over the past 23 years she has traveled far and wide further enhancing her skills and knowledge as a ranger.

        Vieve now uses the Common translation of her Elvish surname, if she tells you her name at all.  She can engage socially but has become intensely more modest, if not fearful, about discussing or promising her skills to others.  She wears one of Marcon’s rings on a chain around her neck as a reminder of the severe consequences of pride.  Letting her guard down is difficult but possible and it is within her repertoire to have a few drinks and laugh.  Love/sex are not high priorities for her right now but she deeply longs for friendship and acceptance.  Vieve can be socially awkward and outspoken, has a dark sense of humor, and has a low tolerance for nonsense and chaos.  She does not like to be rushed and occasionally balks under pressure.  She has not yet learned how to balance her logic and emotions, sometimes ineffectively favoring one over the other in response to stress.  Though very skilled for her age, self-doubt plagues her decisions and her perceived failures (whether the death of something good or the escape of something evil) weigh heavily on her conscience.
