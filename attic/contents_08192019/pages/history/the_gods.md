#### Chapter 1: The Gods

In my travels and my studies I have found that of all things that pervade the hearts and minds of the world none can contest the influence of the divine. Gods are known to every culture and I have yet to meet any creature wandering this or any other plane of existence who is blissfully ignorant of the holy.

Curious to learn more of this phenomena I devoted centuries to studying the divine and how they have shaped the course of civilization. It is a commonly accepted fact that the gods created the world but I have come to wonder if perhaps the world created the gods. No matter which is true, the symbiosis that has formed between the two has been a source of great fascination for me.

In ancient times the gods were many and their influence reached throughout creation. There were as many gods as their were people to worship them. From fire to justice, love, pain or wonder every idea had been claimed as a god’s domain. There was nary a creature who roamed creation that did not worship or commune with the divine constantly. For their part, the gods made their presence known and were unencumbered by subtlety. Their holy power could be felt in the warmth of a fire’s light to the gentle caress of an afternoon breeze. Holiness filled the land and the people basked in it unapologetically.

It was the rise of the kingdom of man that saw the decline of divinity. Humans were the first to reject the god’s influence and this defiance they spread across the realm like a virulent plague. As the great kingdoms of men were born and grew, the holiness that filed the world began to wain until only the truly faithful could feel it for what it was.

Now, to suggest that humans are without divine influence is short-sighted in the extreme. If I have learned anything of humans it is that they are the most unique and diverse creatures in all of creation. As unique as they are, however, they are equally willful and self assured. Humans have claimed a closeness to the divine throughout history, however I doubt the truth of this in their hearts.

Not content to exist in a world fashioned by higher powers, man sought to live in a world shaped by his own will. The rise of ingenuity and industry saw the end of humanity’s dependence upon the divine. What remained was a cursory faith that humanity has clung to as an answer to the as yet unexplained. As they become more able to do for themselves, humanity grows increasingly indifferent to the will of the gods. In time the other races of the world began to follow humanity’s example. Different races and different cultures cling to varying amounts of faith, but all are a meager shadow of ancient devotion.

Religion of the modern world has become a cursory exercise. People flock to places of worship out of a lingering sense of obligation or in a misguided search for salvation. The god’s teachings have similarly evolved overtime to suit the needs of the people who worship them. Those who feel the divine influence enough to exert the gods power seem fewer with each passing generation.

To this day I do not know what has become of the old gods. Perhaps starved for worship they perished or slew one another for what devotion remained. Perhaps they simply grew weary of the people’s indifference and left this place for realms beyond our understanding. All I have been able to learn for certain is that the fate of the gods is no less than tragic.
