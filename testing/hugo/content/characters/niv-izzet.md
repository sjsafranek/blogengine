## Early life
Born and raised in Arcona, Niv was the son of two professors, Serje and Reshi Izzet, who taught at Arcona's University of History and Ancient Cultures. Niv was naturally gifted in school and quickly surpassed the rest of his cohort. He was accepted into the university at the early age of 16.

Since his parents worked full time, he spent much of his early child hood with is grandfather, Alabaster Izzet. Alabaster was a well known inventor (hard of hearing and slightly senile) who created very few inventions that actually worked as intended. One of these inventions was the famous airship Helga the Great (aka Little Missy). Alabaster would take Niv “sailing” to neighboring kingdoms and cities.

The early years of Niv's professional career were spent working for the university as an archaeologist. During this time he discovered and studied several ancient tombs and temples across Arcona. During this time he became quite familiar with alchemy and different types of magical artifacts. He eventually earned a professorship at the University, teaching students about Magic Artifacts, Mechanical Engineering, and Alchemy. After two years he became disinterested with his teaching position, finding it to be rather dull. Niv retired from teaching and set out for a life of adventure!

Niv is often seen jotting down notes in his note book, concocting a strange new potion, or sipping on some fine Arconian ale. He is currently traveling with his fellow companions from the Galazaar's Adventurers Academy: Jack, Twang, Gerethrial, and Merial.

## Tezzeret's Tomb
During his time at the university Niv helped uncover an ancient tomb that once belonged Tezzeret the Inventor. Legend states that [1000 years] ago Tezzeret had assembled an army of constructs and sought out to conquer the [realm].  Before Tezzeret could complete his quest he was poisoned in during an assassination attempt. Although he managed to survive his body was left withered and destroyed as the poison ate through his bones. Tezzeret went into hiding, and it is rumored that he spent the rest of his days trying to restore his body. While excavating tomb, Niv found an ancient text left behind from Tezzeret himself. Niv has tried many times to read/understand the text yet to no avail. As far as he can tell it is a design to a powerful device must not fall into the wrong hands. Niv carries this text in one of his many pockets…

Some would say Niv is fearless to a fault. He always sees the good in others and is willing to lend a helping hand to anyone in need.
Overlook obvious solutions in favor of more complicated ones.
