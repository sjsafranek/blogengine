Biography

Eli was born and raised in the Misty Forest, approximately 100 miles south east of Waterdeep, bordering the Trade Way and about halfway between Daggerford and the Dragonspear Castle. He grew up in a relatively small gnomish village,



Eli’s father was the town doctor and was constantly teaching Eli about anatomy and physiology. On occasion, during the more simple procedures, Eli was allowed to help as his “assistant” (mostly just jotting down notes). One winter season,  mysterious plague spread through the village taking with it almost half the population, including Eli’s father. Eli was only 12 years old.



The loss of Eli’s father weighed heavily on both Eli and his mother. His mother was never the same, forever wracked with grief, and eventually started taking to Eli’s father as though he were there.



When Eli, was of age, he was accepted into Waterdeep’s School of Medicine. Though he did well in his studies and was even at the top of his class, he never did terribly well at the actual practice of medicine.  After loosing several patients he changed tracts and focused on the postmortem studies. Eventually he became a coroner but considered this to be a failure; he had always wanted to help people like his father.




While working as a coroner, Eli began to intensively study the link between life and death and there energies, viewing it at a means to truly understand life and how to preserve it. Most people tend to be put off by the fact he spends much of his time around the deceased, which leaves him feeling pretty lonely. One day, using the knowledge he had obtained through his studies, he worked up the courage and resurrected Leonard, one of his cadavers. Leonard helps Eli with autopsies and never leaves his side.
