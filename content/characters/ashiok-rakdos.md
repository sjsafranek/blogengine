Being raised in [Dhuros](/places/dhuros), and groomed for the battlefield it is a rare occurrence when something strikes fear in Ashiok. Ashiok is "Fearless" almost to a fault, over confident and stubborn. Rarely ask others for help. Erratic and impulsive when angry.


Although Ashiok is slow to trust others. Extremely loyal to his fellow companions.
Willing to “bend” the rules (pragmatic?)

Independence - when people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
Distrust of authority

Devotion to the his clan (i.e. companions).
Protect those who cannot defend themselves.


Necromancy and the undead are abominations. The souls of the deceased should be respected and left at peace.

Enjoys company of “small-lings” and children. He finds that they bring joy into the world and offer a glimpse of a childhood he never experienced.

## Early life

Ashiok was raised in the Kindgom of [Dhuros](/places/dhuros). At the early age of 6, like most Dhurosian dragonborn, Ashiok was taken from his family and trained as a soldier. This all but ended his brief childhood, and he was never able to see his family after this point.


## Career

Being of dragons blood, Ashiok possesses an innate ability to harness arcane magic. This allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks, and was later inducted into Dhuros's [Shadow Guard](TODO) at the age of 17. Ashiok spent the next 10 years in a guerrilla unit of the [Shadow Guard](TODO), 4 of which he was the 'squad leader'. This unit was tasked with disrupting enemy supply lines, torture/interrogation, and attacking smaller villages that were deemed “strategic” targets.

After leading several strikes on neighboring farming villages, Ashiok became incensed about the  [Shadow Guards](TODO) disregard for civilian lives. Over time He began to fostered more disdain for the Dhurosian military and political elite, eventually leading him to abandon the [Shadow Guard](TODO) and flee south into [Galinor](/places/galinor) (~2 years ago).


## Arcons Breath

Shortly after arriving in [Galinor](/kingdoms/galinor) he ran into a halfling monk named [Milo](/characters/milo)... involved in a bar brawl...

[Milo](/characters/milo) and Ashiok traveled around from town to town until they found themselves in the service of [Zeek](/characters/zeek). [Zeek](/characters/zeek) hired them along with 3 other companions (Ovin, Siliki, ) to find a powerful magical item.


## Death

Ashiok, along with [Milo](/characters/milo) were killed when retrieving the [The Fury](TODO).  zombies
