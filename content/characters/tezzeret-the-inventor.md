A millennium ago, Tezzeret had assembled an army of constructs and sought out to conquer the Alarra. Before Tezzeret could complete his quest he was poisoned in during an assassination attempt. Although he managed to survive his body was left withered and destroyed as the poison ate through his bones. Tezzeret went into hiding, and it is rumored that he spent the rest of his days trying to restore his body.
