Every great culture has an alcoholic spirit unique to its own.

Through thousands of years of meticulous refinement and advancements in viticulture, the elves have mastered the art of wine production. Every waft and every sip of elven wine, overwhelms ones the senses of with a full body experience unlike any other. Cherry, oak, black currant and spices, all perfectly balanced, together producing this most decadent and lavish beverage.

And then there are the dwarven ales with their beautiful and rich amber-brown colour.
Bready and caramel malts coalesce with the mild bitterness of hops. As everyone across the multiverse is aware, the foamy head alone is thick enough to feed a starving man for days.

Orcish whiskey is strong enough to grow a full beard on any fair-maiden. If not careful it’ll knock you straight onto your ass, lest you belong to the orcish persuasion. The halflings have their mead, and the gnomes... gnomes... now what do the gnomes have? Some would say the gnomes are too busy with their trinkets and things. Perhaps they are more fond of stimulants such as caffeine or saliva of the majestic aquivark falcon. Whatever it may be, the gnomes really don’t have a spirit of their own; that’s what brings us to the great Gimble Kadwick.

Gimble was born in the town of Ironlyn, to the gnomish clockmaker Seebo Kadwick. Rumor has it that his ma had dumped him off with the poor bastard and ran away with some fancy pants lord from Kingsfall. Seebo never stood a chance. Seebo always wanted to see his son follow in his footsteps. Perhaps one day inheriting the family businesses, Kadwick’s Archive of Temporal Tickers. Unfortunately for Seebo, Gimble had other ambitions.

Once Gimble got a hold of the famous [Professor Izzet’s](/worlds/alarra/characters/niv-izzet) book, “Coalescing Concoctions and Other Brews”, he was hooked! Gimble swore that he would be the one to introduce the world’s first true gnomish spirit. He packed up his things and moved to Bellum to begin his training with the infamous brewers guild, Tomr Federation of Zymologists (aka TFZ).

Sure Gimble was a natural at alchemy. They say he could whip up a Bubbly Fogweed Potion  using nothing but flogs wort, harpy spit and fading brittlebush. But what do gnomes really know  about the subtle sciences of alcohol?

Our story begins after an evening of excessive alcohol consumption...
