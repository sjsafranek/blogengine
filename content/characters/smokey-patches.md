Smokey is a tall and lanky tabaxi with dark gray fur and black leopard spots.
He is fairly expressive, easily embarrassed, and self conscious.
When he lies his tail often gives himself away.
Like most tabaxis, Smokey absolutely despises getting wet and hates being around water.

Wants to prove that he is “better” than his father.
Yearns for the approval from others.

Smokey is one of the founding members for [The Rusty Tankards](/parties/the-rusty-tankards).

## Early life
Smokey was born to the Gleaming Glade Clan in the jungles of [TDB]. His parents are Quick Thunder and Rain (Rain of the Fall). Rain is the oldest sister of the chieftain making Quick Thunder the next in line.

Smokey was always small compared to the other cubs in the pack. He was considered the "runt" of the litter and was never very good at catching anything larger than a fish or songbird. This made him an outcast to his fellow cohort while he was growing up. The other cubs would make fun and ridicule him. Smokey would pretend he didn’t care or notice. Due to his leaner stature, he grew to be faster and more agile than most of the others.

From an early age he took a liking to another cub his age named Locket (Locket of the Heart). While she never paid much attention to him, Smokey would constantly try to impress her with various antics. These antics grew more and more elaborate over time, eventually leading Smokey to get involved in dance and music. To this day he still has feelings for Locket, despite her ignoring, making fun, and talking down to him (similar to Victoria Forrester and Tristan Thorn in Stardust).

The Gleaming Glade Clan is a fairly patriarchal society and many of its members (especially the elders) frowned upon Smokey’s love for the performing arts. While his mother was always supportive, his father was not. Quick Thunder would constantly berate Smokey and express his disappointment that he did not have a “real” son.

A year and a half ago, Quick Thunder was giving Smokey another one of his "You are a Disappointment" speeches. Smokey was finally fed up and the two engaged in a heated shouting match, ending with Smokey grabbing a few of his belongings and storming out. He made his way to the city [TBD] and never looked back. He hasn't spoken to his parents or other members of the clan since.

## The Rusty Tankards
Over the next few months Smokey got by working as a street performer as he made his way up north. Hitching a few rides with trade caravans and working odd jobs, he moved from town to town. Eventually he met up with several traveling musicians and they formed [The Rusty Tankards](/parties/the-rusty-tankards).

## God of Metal
Upon seeing the wonders of [Grunk Godpunch](/characters/grunk-godpunch) deity at work, Smokey made a pact with the [God of Metal](TODO)
