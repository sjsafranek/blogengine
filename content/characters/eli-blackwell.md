## Early life

Eli grew up in the small gnomish village of Elderbrook, nestled in the Misty Forest, about 100 miles south east of Waterdeep.

Dr. Burton Blackwell, Eli's father, was Elderbrook's town doctor. Eli was fascinated by everything anatomy and physiology and loved helping his father. Eli helped out by jotting down notes and preforming simple procedures.


### The Long Winter

One winter season, when Eli was only 12 years old, mysterious plague spread through the village taking with it almost half the population. Eli's father was among the fallen.

The loss of Eli's father weighed heavily on both Eli and his mother, Almyra Blackwell. Almyra mother was wracked with grief over Burton's passing and never recovered. A few years after Burton's death, Almyra started taking as though Burton was in the room... always by her side. Eli had a really hard time seeing his mother this way, prompting him to eventually leave for Waterdeep. He makes a point to visit a few times a year and feels guilty for leaving.


## Education

When Eli, was of age, he was accepted into Waterdeep’s School of Medicine. Though he did extremely well in his studies (was even at the top of his class), he never did well at the actual practice/application of medicine. After loosing several patients he changed tracts and focused on the postmortem studies. Eventually he became a coroner but considered this to be a failure; he had always wanted to help people like his father.


### Necromancy

{{< columns >}}

While working as a coroner, Eli began to intensively study the link between life and death and there entwined energies, viewing it at a means to truly understand life and how to preserve it. Most people tend to be put off by the fact he spends much of his time around the deceased, which leaves him feeling pretty lonely. One day, using the knowledge he had obtained through his studies, he worked up the courage and resurrected Leonard. Leonard is Eli's zombie bestie. Leonard helps Eli with autopsies and never leaves his side.
