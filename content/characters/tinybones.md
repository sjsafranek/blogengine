Once a brave and valiant knight from the Kingdom of Galinor, he is now but a shell of his former self. Well... To be perfectly honest, the "shell" is the piece that is missing. You see, this undead skeleton from beyond the grave seems frightening at first. But he is nothing more than a gentle giant. Never stopping to aid a creature in need.

## Undead Awakening

120 years ago, while on a quest for the king, a knight by the name of Sir Sagard the Handsome the came across a jet black oil lamp. This lamp was covered in strange arcane runes that seemed to glow in the fire light. Sagard became captivated by this object. He became obsessed. Fearing that one of his fellow knights would steal it from him, he set off across the Yeabetian desert. He could feel the power that surged within the lamp, that desired to be free.

One night, as Sagard gazed upon the lamp, an efreeti by the name of Yinessie (The Wicked) appeared before him.

"You have done well Sagard", Yinessie said quietly. "I shall grant you power beyond your wildest desires! Wealth beyond your dream of dreams. I shall grant you, one wish."

The excitement began to stir. Think of the possibilities!?! Thoughts of glory and conquest raced through Sagard's mind.

Eventually greed got the better of him. Sagard wished for immortality.

"I wish to live beyond my years. Never fading from this world."

Yinessie smiled coldly, "As you wish."

Dark flames began to kick up around Sagard's feet. The heat searing his skin.

Sagard yelled in agony "You tricked me!"

Yinessie laughing, "Everything of value, comes with a cost..."

The fires climbed up his body. Burning away his flesh. Burning away the muscle and other tissue. Leaving nothing but the charred skeletal remains you see today.

The lamp was no where to be seen.
