Once a brave and valiant knight from the Kingdom of Galinor, he is now but a shell of his former self. Well... To be perfectly honest, the "shell" is the piece that is missing. You see, this undead skeleton from beyond the grave seems frightening at first. But he is nothing more than a gentle giant. Never stopping to aid a creature in need.

## Undead Awakening

120 years ago, while on a quest for the king, a knight by the name of Sir Jesper the Champion came across a jet black oil lamp. This lamp was covered in strange arcane runes that seemed to glow in the fire light. Jesper became captivated by this object. He became obsessed. Fearing that one of his fellow knights would steal it from him, he set off across the Yeabetian desert. He could feel the power that surged within the lamp, the power desired to be free.

One night, as Jesper gazed upon the lamp, an efreeti by the name of Yemnazi (The Wicked) appeared before him.

"You have done well Jesper", Yemnazi said quietly. "I shall grant you power beyond your wildest desires! Wealth beyond your dream of dreams. I shall grant you, one wish."

The excitement began to stir. Think of the possibilities!?! Thoughts of glory and conquest raced through Jesper's mind.

Eventually greed got the better of him. Jesper wished for immortality.

"I wish to live beyond my years. Never fading to the sands of time."

Yemnazi smiled coldly, "As you wish."

Dark flames began to kick up around Jesper's feet. The heat searing his skin.

Jesper yelled in agony "You tricked me!"

Yemnazi laughing, "Everything of value, comes with a cost..."

The fires climbed up his body. Burning away his flesh. Burning away the muscle and other tissue. Leaving nothing but the charred skeletal remains you see today.

The lamp was no where to be seen.


## Seclusion

Jesper made his way to the nearest town. When the people saw him they screamed in terror and chased him out. He ran into the country side and hid in the woods. Cursing the fate that had been bestowed upon him. It wasn't long before he became depressed and recluse. Would he never know love or kindness again? The seasons came and went, years passed as he meditated.

Over time he began to notice little things that he had never noticed before. A spider spinning a web. The sun rising as if to gift the world a new day. The cool air blowing through fields of spring flowers on Astor Mountains. It was all, beautiful. Of course it had always been there, but Jesper had never taken the time to appreciate such simple things.

One day a gnome by the name of [Eli Blackwell](/characters/eli-blackwell) came across Jesper's path.
