# The Direlands

The Direlands appear to have been formed after a massive cave in. The entire area having once been completely underground.
Stalagmites litter the ground, great spires taller than a 3 story building at times. With the elven city on one side, the ground quickly became very fertile from their nature magic they usually use on their forests.
Strange moss and what seem to be a never ending supply of small, and very large, corpses of all kinds strewn around the ground. It seems like creatures that find their way in, don't often get out.
