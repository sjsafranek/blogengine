# Bellum

Bellum is one of the first towns built up after the king gained control. The towsfolk mainly being composed of travelers from distant lands. Unable to leave again once docked, they built a small port town, expanding it as the population needed, though the buildings are upkept, they haven't been rebuilt for many years.

(Basically Bellum never really got any super nice architecture, just spreading out wider)
