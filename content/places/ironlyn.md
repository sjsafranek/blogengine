# Ironlyn

Ironlyn was built as a go-between for the mines in Ashcraft and the elven city of Aquivark, housing many blacksmiths and equipment shops. Though more unexpectedly, it also houses a few elves, working to trade herbs and potions for ores foreign to their lands. It's buildings are thick stone and hardwoods, constructed for function above all else.
