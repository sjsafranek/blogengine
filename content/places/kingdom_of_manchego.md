# Kingdom of Manchego

A small village in the middle of a large grassy field. A 4 ft wooden palisade wall surrounds the perimeter of the tiny kingdom. Bordering the outer wall and moving inward, are simple tiny farm houses with well tended fields growing various types of grain. The occasional windmill is sprinkled through out the farming region but stand no more than 12 feet tall. A handful of these farms produce different types of berries (blueberry, boysenberry, loganberry, etc).

At the kingdoms center, lies a courtyard surrounded by an 8 ft stone wall and ~20 ft tall castle. Both are constructed of bluish grey river stone. Legend says that these were a gift from the **Lake Deity** (Eldath).

The kingdoms inhabitants consist of ~500 mousefolk and one large mutant harengon zombie named *The Foo*. **King Zeepyjeep Grayfur VIII** along with a high court consisting of 4 advisors rules over the kingdom. They are known for being kind, peaceful and just.

Unlike other kingdoms the citizens of Manchego don't quite understand the use of gold and silver. Instead they deal in berries, grain, and most important of all... cheese.

## The High Court of Manchego

### King Zeepyjeep Grayfur VIII
An older and rather large (fat) mousefolk with grayfur as his name would suggest. The oversized golden crown with a white fur rim is constantly falling over his eyes, causing him to pop it back up. He speaks very quiety in a series of soft chirps which is often hard for non-mousefolk to understand. 

### Feetoveet Whitefoot
A young and thin mousefolk with whitefur. He is the kings translator and speaks with a deep booming voice that doesn't match his small stature.

### Yeetuweep Brownfoot
The high priestess of the **Lake Deity** (Eldath). Older mousefolk (late 70s in human years), and wears flowing white and green robes.

### Geetobeep Redpaw
The commander of the **Knights of Manchego**. Strong and confident auburn fur.

### Veepakeek Wildwhisker
Middle aged mousefolk with whiskers that stick out in every direction, most of which are bent and gnarled. She talks at rappid pace. Often found constructing amazing clockwork gadgets and alchemical concoctions. Loves her coffee.


## The Foo
Once an enemy of Manchego set on the distruction of its inhabitants, **The Foo** is now a valuable member of society. **Brother Hug** reanimated this fearsome mutated harengon. Standing at 10 feet tall he towers over the mousefolk. Wears a backpack containing two large tanks of liquid (green > enlarge, blue > healing) with hoses into his arms. Can be found helping with building construction or "playing" soccer with the youngsters.
