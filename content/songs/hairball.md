[Verse 1] <br>
I'm terrified of everyone that I meet <br>
Scratch your feet completely randomly! <br>
Knocking your things just to see them fall <br>
I'll rule the world then groom my balls!

[Chorus] <br>
Hairball! <br>
*cough cough hack cough* <br>
I gotta fucking hairball!

[Verse 2] <br>
Play with my ball of yarn <br>
Then I'll go and burn down your barn <br>
And you'll never know it was me! <br>
Cause I'm your cute little kitty

[Chorus] <br>
Hairball! <br>
*cough cough hack cough* <br>
I gotta fucking hairball!
