[Verse 1] <br>
Em &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A7 <br>
Woke, woke up this morning <br>
The sun was high, but the rain it kept on pouring <br>
Didn't know, know who I was could have been a rabbit, fish or a bug <br>
The voice said listen, just listen to me <br>
It's the golden rule, better than therapy

[Chorus] <br>
G <br>
Now I'm living with a band <br>
F <br>
Traveling all accross this land <br>
E <br>
Never want it to go away <br>
F &nbsp; &nbsp; G <br>
All I want is to listen to them play

[Verse 2] <br>
Swirling, mass of confusion <br>
I'm captivated by this illusion <br>
Memories, have all left my mind <br>
I tried to think, but haven't had the time <br>
Oh hear me! Why can't you hear me? <br>
Shouted the voice from the edge of the ever expanding clearing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 / Outro] <br>
Now it's time, that time again <br>
To end our set, good by all my friends <br>
Hope to see you some other day <br>
Thanks for listening to us play...
