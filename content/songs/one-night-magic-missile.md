[Verse 1] <br>
Your mother says, I've got problems <br>
Yeah? Well she might be right <br>
Your father says I am dangerous <br>
Cause I'm only hear for one night

[Chorus] <br>
One night, magic missile <br>
One night, don't have to aim <br>
One night, magic missile - I'll be your <br>
One night, critical hit

[Verse 2] <br>
Now your sister, should have warned your <br>
I was with her the other night <br>
Your brother would kill me if he knew <br>
And he'd be perfectly justified

[Chorus]

[Chorus] *Quiet and build up*

[Chorus]
