Capo 7

[Verse 1] <br>
G &nbsp; &nbsp; G &nbsp; &nbsp; G &nbsp; &nbsp; G <br>
I'm flying away from here <br>
Em &nbsp; &nbsp; Em &nbsp; &nbsp; C &nbsp; &nbsp; C <br>
Where the skies are always clear <br>
Soring across the sea <br>
I'm your ancient enemy

[Verse 2] <br>
Gonna burn all your homes (to the ground) <br>
Watch out! Look up! What's that sound? <br>
Scortching - ember fires <br>
Bodies stacked onto pires

[Pre Chorus] <br>
Asus4 &nbsp; &nbsp; A7<br>
No one &nbsp; &nbsp; understands...

[Chorus] <br>
G &nbsp; &nbsp; G &nbsp; &nbsp; Em &nbsp; &nbsp; C <br>
A dragons misery <br>
A dragons misery

[Verse 3] <br>
As smoke filles the air <br>
Running half blind and scared <br>
You'll live another day <br>
If you chose not to stay

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
