_Tune of "I just died in your arms tonight" by Cutting Crew_

[Intro] <br>
I wanna misty step into your heart <br>
You're so close but too far away <br>
Wanna misty step into your heart <br>

[Verse 1] <br>
I see you lying on the battlefield <br>
I've gotta potion, need to get it to your <br>
But I don't got the movement <br>
To make it all the way <br>
Healing word isn't an option <br>
Out of spell slots, just a dagger to my name <br>
I got to save your <br>
Even if it kills me

[Chorus] <br>
I - wanna misty step into your heart <br>
You're so close but too far away <br>
Wanna misty step into your heart <br>
oh wo <br>
I - wanna misty step into your heart <br>
You're so close but too far away <bR>
Should have disengaged <br>
I should have disengaged

[Verse 2] <br>
It's my turn in the initiative order
I'd dash to you, but it's no use!! <br>
Potions take an action <br>
Wish I was hasted
