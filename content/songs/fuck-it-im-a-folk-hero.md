Capo 1?

[Verse 1] <br>
G &nbsp; &nbsp; C <br>
My father said, wish I had a son <br>
G &nbsp; &nbsp; D <br>
Cause you're no boy of mine <br>
G &nbsp; &nbsp; C <br>
So I want to my ma, kissed her goodbye <br>
G &nbsp; &nbsp; D G G <br>
and said I'm not coming back this time

[Verse 2] <br>
So I packed up my things and away I went <br>
To sail across the sea <br>
Blinders on and full steam ahead <br>
Chasing all my foolish dreams

[Chorus] <br>
Folk hero <br>
Folk hero <br>
I just want to be a <br>
Folk hero <br>
Folk hero <br>
Folk hero <br>
Fuck it! I'm a <br>
Folk hero

[Verse 3] <br>
We sailed for days to my despair <br>
Thought I've must have been a loon <br>
But when we arrived at the port <br>
I heard this ol forgotten tune <br>

[Chorus]

[Verse 4] <br>
I left behind a girl that I love <br>
But we were meant to be <br>
I know it's hard, but in the back of my mind <br>
I knew she never noticed me

[Chorus]

[Verse 5] <br>
Started traveling town to town <bR>
But I didn't have a clue <br>
Almost gave up - but thats when <br>
I met all of You

[Chorus / Outro] <r>
Folk heroes <br>
Folk heroes <br>
We just want to be a <br>
Folk heroes <br>
Folk heroes <br>
Folk heroes <br>
Fuck it! Now we're all <br>
Folk heroes
