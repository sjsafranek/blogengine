<!-- #### Golden Rule - The Rusty Tankards -->

[Verse 1]
Em		A7		
Woke, woke up this morning
The sun was high, but the rain it kept on pouring
Didn't know, know who I was could have been a rabbit, fish or a bug
The voice said listen, just listen to me
It's the golden rule, better than therapy

[Chorus]
G
Now I'm living with a band
F
Traveling all accross this land
E
Never want it to go away
F				 G
All I want is to listen to them play

[Verse 2]
Swirling, mass of confusion
I'm captivated by this illusion
Memories, have all left my mind
I tried to think, but haven't had the time
Oh hear me! Why can't you hear me?
Shouted the voice from the edge of the ever expanding clearing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 / Outro]
Now it's time, that time again
To end our set, good by all my friends
...
