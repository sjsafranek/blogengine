<!-- #### Thunderwave The Status Quo - The Rusty Tankards -->

* Tune of "Black Velvet" by Alannah Myles *

[Verse 1]

[[Durninish]] in the middle of a dry spell

|Jimmy Rodgers on the Victrola up high|

While [[Tamborian]] financed our tour

|The sun is settin' like molasses in the/ sky|

Grunk is rocking out, to Tempest in his head

Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for


[Chorus]

Thunderwave, yeah - you learned how to toe the line

Thunderwave, now you're working all the time

The new religion is there to set your free

Thunderwave the status quo
