<!-- #### One Night, Magic Missile - The Rusty Tankards -->

G	D	A	A

[Verse 1]

Your mother says, I've got problems

Yeah? Well she might be right

Your father says I am dangerous

Cause I'm only hear for one night


[Chorus]

One night, magic missile

One night, don't have to aim

One night, magic missile - I'll be your

One night, critical hit


[Verse 2]

Now your sister, should have warned your

I was with her the other night

Your brother would kill me if he knew

And he'd be perfectly justified


[Chorus]


[Chorus] *Quiet and build up*


[Chorus]
