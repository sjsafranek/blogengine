<!-- #### Fuck It! I'm a Folk Hero - The Rusty Tankards -->

[Verse 1]
G				C

My father said, wish I had a son

G					D

Cause you're no boy of mine

G					C

So I want to my ma, kissed her goodbye

G			D		G		G

and said I'm not coming back this time


[Verse 2]

So I packed up my things and away I went

To sail across the sea

Blinders on and full steam ahead

Chasing all my foolish dreams


[Chorus]

Folk hero

Folk hero

I just want to be a

Folk hero

Folk hero

Folk hero

Fuck it! I'm a

Folk hero


[Verse 3]

We sailed for days to my despair

Thought I've must have been a loon

But when we arrived at the port

I heard this ol forgotten tune


[Chorus]


[Verse 4]

I left behind a girl that I love

But we were meant to be

I know it's hard, but in the back of my mind

I knew she never noticed me


[Chorus]


[Verse 5]

Started traveling town to town

But I didn't have a clue

Almost gave up - but thats when

I met all of Your


[Chorus / Outro]

Folk heroes

Folk heroes

We just want to be a

Folk heroes

Folk heroes

Folk heroes

Fuck it! Now we're all

Folk heroes
