<!-- #### Misty Step (Into Your Heart) - The Rusty Tankards -->

* Tune of "I just died in your arms tonight" by Cutting Crew *

[Intro]

I - wanna misty step into your heart

You're so close but too far away

Wanna misty step into your heart

-


[Verse 1]

I see you lying on the battlefield

I've gotta potion, need to get it to your

But I don't got the movement

To make it all the way

Healing word isn't an option

Out of spell slots, just a dagger to my name

I got to save your

Even if it kills me


[Chorus]

I - wanna misty step into your heart

You're so close but too far away

Wanna misty step into your heart

oh wo

I - wanna misty step into your heart

You're so close but too far away

Should have disengaged

I should have disengaged


[Verse 2]

It's my turn in the initiative order

I'd dash but it's no use!!

Potions take an action

Wish I was hasted
