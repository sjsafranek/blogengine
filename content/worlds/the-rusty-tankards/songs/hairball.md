<!-- #### Hairball - The Rusty Tankards -->
[Verse 1]
I'm terrified of everyone that I meet
Scratch your feet completely randomly!
Knocking your things just to see them fall
I'll rule the world then groom my balls!

[Chorus]
Hairball!
*cough cough hack cough*
I gotta fucking hairball!

[Verse 2]
Play with my ball of yarn
Then I'll go and burn down your barn
And you'll never know it was me!
Cause I'm your cute little kitty

[Chorus]
Hairball!
*cough cough hack cough*
I gotta fucking hairball!
