Mul hates being a fairy. He hates every damned thing about it. From the extreme happiness, obsession over sweets, to the thin cloud of fairy dust following him around, he absolutely despises it all…

## Early Life

Mul was born and raised in the Feywild like all fairy folk. While it is common knowledge amongst fairies, they don’t have “parents” in the traditional sense. Legend states that the Summer Queen (Titania, Archfey) planted the ancient bitterblossom trees all across the realm. It is from these trees that all fairies are birthed, growing in flower-like pods. Once these pods open, the newborn fairies are adopted by fairy communities from all over the multiverse (after all, it takes a village). Mul was adopted by the Plumfoam Empire, lying at the heart of the Fairy Godmother’s realm, within the Feywild.

From an early age it was clear that Mul didn’t “fit in”. While the rest of Plumfoam was in a near perpetual state of celebration, Mul thought this was pathologically absurd. What could possibly be so extraordinary that one would feel compelled to celebrate to that degree… let alone an entire fucking kingdom?! His negative attitude caused him to clash with other members of the community, making him a sort of “outcast” (to whatever degree is possible for living in a super accepting and overly inclusive community).




## Fairy Godmother & The Material Plane

Despite Mul’s attitude the Fairy Godmother took a liking to him. One day the Fairy God Mother went to visit him:





> FAIRY GODMOTHER floats down from the sky with a beam of sunlight piercing through the tree canopy illuminating her fairy dust. Yellow-orange butterfly wings outstretched and hair the color of cotton candy spiralling up towards the sky.

> FAIRY GODMOTHER <br>
> (With a radiant smile) <br>
> “Mulberry! My most fantastic subject!”

> MULBERRY <br>
> Oh dear god... what does this old bird want? <br>
> "Please, just call me Mul..."

> FAIRY GODMOTHER <br>
> "Oh! Yes! Of course... Mul. Do you know why I am here?"

> MULBERRY <br>
> How am I supposed to fucking know?!? Do I look like I can read minds? Maybe that insane hair color of hers has finally boiled her brain... <br>
> "...No?"

> FAIRY GODMOTHER <br>
> (Concered look on face) <br>
> "As you are well aware.. Plumfoam isn’t… well… it’s not the right fit for you…"

> MULBERRY <br>
> No shit. I don’t see how this is the right fit for anyone. It’s like a god damned cult where everyone keeps drinking from the acid laced kool-aid.

> FAIRY GODMOTHER <br>
> (Hands jester to slow down) <br>
> "Why don’t you just hear me out."

> MULBERRY <br>
> (Perplexed look on his face) <br>
> WTf?! Can.. she read my mind..?

> FAIRY GODMOTHER <br>
> "As you may know, I value each and everyone of our kind."

> MULBERRY <br>
> (Smirk on face) <br>
> Value everyone? I can think of a few surplus individuals…

> FAIRY GODMOTHER <br>
> (Somber look on face) <br>
> "I want nothing more but for joy and happiness for each and everyone of us."

> MULBERRY <br>
> (Eyes widen in disbelief) <br>
> Yup she’s lost it. The bitch has finally lost it.

> FAIRY GODMOTHER <br>
> (With the biggest smile imaginable) <br>
> "Mulberry, I am sending you on a most important quest… To find your ‘Joy’!"

> MULBERRY <br>
> (With a dumbfounded look, morphing into a scowl) <br>
> "I think I would rather be burned at the stake…"







The Fairy Godmother blessed Mul and sent him off to travel distant lands in search of his ‘Joy’. Fairy Godmother led Mul to a clearing where the famous inventor Alabaster Izzet was waiting with his airship, “Helga the Great”. Helga set sail with Mul and planeshifted to the material plane.

The material plane was unlike the Feywild in almost every way. While every town Mul went to was much larger than he was used to, the atmosphere was calm. No hyper active towns folk prepping for the upcoming celebration. No obtrusive bright colors overwhelming your field of view. Just the sights and sounds of individuals going through the same old monotonous routine day in and day out. Mul found this extremely soothing and relaxing.

It wasn’t long until Mulberry discovered the most beautiful thing he had ever come across, Ale.




## Cordelia

Mulberry doesn’t remember why he ended up on the Cordelia. Could it have been one drink to many? Perhaps it was that “Open Bar” sign placing him under some sort of magical enchantment. All that Mul remembers is waking up in a drunken stupor as the ship set out to sail. But honestly… does it really matter?
